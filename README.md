# Ray Tracing Tests

A comparison of gravitational lensing ray-tracing methods, comparing the Born approximation with full ray-tracing including lens-lens coupling effects. We are using the Dorian code from (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08540) and the GLASS code from (https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01942) to do these comparisons.

## Overview

This repository tests the impact of different ray tracing strategies on weak lensing forward modeling. We compare:

- **Born Approximation**: Traditional approach treating lensing as a thin-lens approximation
- **Full Ray-tracing**: Complete treatment including lens-lens coupling and deflection accumulation

The analysis uses high-resolution N-body simulation data to generate convergence maps and compare their statistical properties through power spectrum analysis.

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd RayTracingTests

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv raytracing_env
source raytracing_env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
raytracing_env\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download Simulation Data

Download the first simulation from the Gower Street Simulations:

```bash
# Create data directory
mkdir -p data/sim00001

# Download simulation data (example for first simulation)
# Visit: http://star.ucl.ac.uk/GowerStreetSims/simulations/
# Download the lightcone files and place them in data/sim00001/

# Required files structure:
# data/sim00001/
# â”œâ”€â”€ control.par              # Simulation parameters
# â”œâ”€â”€ z_values.txt            # Redshift information
# â”œâ”€â”€ run.00024.lightcone.npy # Lightcone data files
# â”œâ”€â”€ run.00025.lightcone.npy
# â””â”€â”€ ...                     # Additional lightcone files
```

**Note**: The simulation data files are large (~GB each). Download only the lightcone files you need for your redshift range of interest.

### 3. Run Analysis

```bash
# Generate convergence maps using both methods
python run_dorian_full.py

# View results in Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb
```
